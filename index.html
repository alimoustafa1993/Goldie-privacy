<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>
Goldie (also known as <strong>Ancient Gold Coin</strong>) respects your privacy and is committed
to protecting user data. This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used,
and protected when you use the Goldie mobile application.
</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<p>
Goldie collects only the minimum information required to operate core application features.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Account Information:</strong> Users sign in using Google Authentication.
    We receive a unique user ID and basic profile information required for account identification.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Wallet & Transactions:</strong> The app stores virtual wallet balances and
    transaction history related to in-app usage of virtual currencies (AGC and SGC).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Location Data (Optional):</strong> Location access may be requested only to provide
    the Qibla direction feature. Location data is not stored or shared.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Notifications:</strong> The app may send push notifications related to account activity,
    subscriptions, or important updates.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Goldie does <strong>not</strong> collect contacts, SMS data, call logs, photos, audio,
or device files.
</p>

<h2>2. In-App Virtual Currencies</h2>

<p>
Goldie includes two <strong>virtual in-app currencies</strong> used exclusively inside the application:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>AGC (Ancient Gold Coin):</strong> A virtual in-app currency purchased through
    <strong>Google Play Billing</strong> or earned through in-app features such as referrals.
    AGC is used only to unlock digital content, subscriptions, and features inside the app.
    <strong>AGC has no real-world monetary value and cannot be withdrawn as real money.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>SGC (Silver Gold Coin):</strong> A virtual reward currency earned through
    app participation such as referrals. SGC can be converted into AGC for in-app use only.
    <strong>SGC is virtual and has no real-world monetary value.</strong>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Payments</h2>

<p>
All purchases are processed securely through <strong>Google Play Billing</strong>.
Goldie does not store, process, or have access to users’ credit card or payment information.
</p>

<h2>4. Subscriptions</h2>

<p>
Goldie offers optional digital subscriptions that unlock premium features within the app.
Subscriptions are virtual, non-transferable, and managed securely through Google Play.
Subscription status is validated by the server and used only to control access to app features.
</p>

<h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>

<p>
Goldie may include educational and religious content suitable for general audiences.
We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 13.

and monitored.
